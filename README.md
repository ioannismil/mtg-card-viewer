# Magic The Gathering Card Viewer

## Intro

This is a Magic The Gathering Card Viewer. It's written in Java and the GUI was designed using Netbeans' GUI builder. The following project is a result of me not wanting to open my browser everytime I wanted to check out a card, either because I wanted to see what it does, how much mana it costs, how much money it costs or on which formats it's playable. I hope you enjoy my little project and if you have any suggestions for any features to add feel free to message me on [reddit](http://reddit.com/u/rockax). Lastly it's my first project in java so excuse any bad practices.

## Getting Started

In order to use the app you have to download the project open it in you IDE(I'm  using [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/)). Also you will need the [Jackson JSON library](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjacksonall190jar.htm). Right click on the project and hit Clean and Build. Navigate to the project which is probably under \Documents\NetBeansProjects\mtg-card-viewer\dist and there you will find a .jar file which you can copy and paste to your desktop and use from now on.

## How to:

Type the name of the card in the first box and click search or press enter. We are pulling data from the scryfall api so the image and text may take a little time to appear if you typed something wrong a message will appear informing you. 


## Outro 

Thanks for passing by my little project and if you have any questions feel free to ask!
