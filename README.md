# Magic The Gathering Card Viewer

## Intro

This is a Magic The Gathering Card Viewer. It's written in Java and the GUI was designed using Netbeans' GUI builder. The following project is a result of me not wanting to open my browser everytime I wanted to check out a card, either because I wanted to see what it does, how much mana does it cost, how much money does it cost or on which formats it's playable. I hope you enjoy my little project and if you have any suggestions for any features to add feel free to message me on [reddit](http://reddit.com/u/rockax). Lastly it's my first project in java so excuse any bad practices.

## Getting Started

In order to use the app you have to download the project open it in you IDE(I'm  using [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/)). Right click on the project and hit Clean and Build. Navigate to the project which is probably under \Documents\NetBeansProjects\mtg-card-viewer\dist and there you will find a .jar file which you can copy and paste to your desktop and use from now on.

## Outro 

Thanks for passing by my little project and if you have any questions feel free to ask!
